 - allow semicolon as argument separator (Axel Pratzner)
 - added experimental Excel97 generation. You can test it with setVersion():
   Beware! this method will be deprecated in a future release (when
   Excel97 becomes the default). It is only available for testing
   purposes. Use it at your own risk.
